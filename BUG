Dear Team,

I am Vaishnavi Pardeshi working as a security researcher and I found a bug on your site, report of the bug is as follows :

Vulnerability name : 

      Signup Page OAuth Misconfiguration Giving Access To Created Account Leads to Account Takeover. 

(Critical, Please Fix This ASAP!)

 (https://questdb.eu.auth0.com/u/signup?state=hKFo2SB5b3RjU3ZhczFQMFlGY1lGQXFjdEwwOGdnWjBHbHBwRqFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIDdvS1Q0Ul9uaHpmME9zZ3lUQWdpV1MyUDVaci1Gczlko2NpZNkgcGZWdmVCRTJYTDZmeTRHR3Z2N1N1N2lSV3RiWnNmbmQ)

Description:
OAuth is a functionality used by a user for easy sign up or login on your domain. In this vulnerability, an attacker can easily control the victim's account, if the victim uses OAuth functionality.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
ATTACKER PHASE :-

Go to https://questdb.eu.auth0.com/u/signup?state=hKFo2SB5b3RjU3ZhczFQMFlGY1lGQXFjdEwwOGdnWjBHbHBwRqFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIDdvS1Q0Ul9uaHpmME9zZ3lUQWdpV1MyUDVaci1Gczlko2NpZNkgcGZWdmVCRTJYTDZmeTRHR3Z2N1N1N2lSV3RiWnNmbmQ And go to signup.
Make an account with the victim's email address.
Now you have access to the victim's account through email ID and password.
VICTIM COMES :-
The victim will create an account through Google OAuth functionality.
Thus, the victim is not required to set a password.
EXPLOIT:-

You can access the victim's account through the password you set in the attacker's  phase.
So, you can use the victim's account whenever you want!

POC:
Video Attached

Impact:
1)  An attacker can take over the account of the victim.
2)  If the victim makes any changes to his account(e.g: updates the name etc.) the same will be reflected in the attacker's account.
